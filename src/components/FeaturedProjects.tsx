    designDescription: "Save Rapunzel features a dual-interface design that supports both young learners and their educators. The student-facing interface uses a colorful, fairy tale-inspired palette that balances a sense of wonder with clear readability.",
    colorPalette: "Earthy, storybook-inspired color palette with deep blue, moss green, golden yellow, warm copper, and brick red.",
    animationDescription: "Strategic animations support the learning experience without causing distraction. The introductory sequence - showing Rapunzel walking through the tower with a gradual zoom to the window - replaced our original storybook concept and significantly improved engagement metrics. Similarly, the prince's climbing animation provides immediate feedback on correct answers while strengthening emotional investment in the storyline.",
