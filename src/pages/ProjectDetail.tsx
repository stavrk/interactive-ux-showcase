    overview: "ROOMIE is an interactive guide designed to simplify the often overwhelming process of moving into a first apartment for young adults. The platform provides a user-friendly workflow with an interactive timeline, budget calculator, roommate agreement generator, and virtual room planner.",
    problem: "Moving into a first apartment can be overwhelming for young adults. They often lack the necessary knowledge and tools to manage the process effectively, leading to stress and potential mistakes.",
    solution: "ROOMIE simplifies the moving process by providing a comprehensive digital guide with interactive tools and resources. The platform breaks down the process into manageable steps, offering clear guidance and support at each stage.",
    challenges: `A key challenge in the development of Roomie was how to present educational content in a way that feels approachable, interactive, and non-intimidatingâ€”especially for users navigating the emotionally sensitive transition into their first shared living situation.

To solve this, we designed playful micro-interactions, modular content blocks, and gentle language cues that guide users without overwhelming them. We conducted multiple usability tests to ensure the experience felt supportive rather than formal or instructional, ultimately creating a product that informs while empowering users through empathy and clarity.`,
    outcome: "ROOMIE empowers young adults to confidently navigate the process of moving into their first apartment. By providing clear, accessible information and interactive tools, the platform reduces stress and promotes successful independent living.",
