    overview: "Save Rapunzel is a dual-purpose educational platform consisting of an interactive educational game for students and a content creation tool for educators. The platform transforms traditional learning material into engaging game experiences built around the classic fairy tale of Rapunzel.",
    challenge: "Traditional educational materials often fail to capture students' attention, particularly for challenging subjects. Educators need tools to create engaging content without extensive technical knowledge, while students need learning experiences that are both educational and entertaining.",
    solution: "A dual-purpose educational platform with an interactive game where correct answers help the prince climb Rapunzel's hair, and a content management system allowing educators to create custom question sets without coding knowledge.",
    animationDescription: "Strategic animations support the learning experience without causing distraction. The introductory sequence - showing Rapunzel walking through the tower with a gradual zoom to the window - replaced our original storybook concept and significantly improved engagement metrics. Similarly, the prince's climbing animation provides immediate feedback on correct answers while strengthening emotional investment in the storyline.",
