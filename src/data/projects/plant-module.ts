  overview: "This e-learning module builds confidence in plant care through engaging, interactive content. Focusing on six common houseplants, it provides essential care guidance in a user-friendly format that addresses the hesitation many feel when considering houseplant ownership.",
  challenge: "Many potential plant owners lack confidence in their ability to properly care for houseplants. This hesitation stems from uncertainty about watering needs, light requirements, and general maintenance. The challenge was to create a learning solution that would effectively build confidence through clear, accessible information and interactive learning experiences.",
  solution: "I designed a comprehensive e-learning module focused on six key houseplants, with detailed care instructions, interactive assessments, and engaging visuals. The module employs a branching navigation model allowing users to personalize their learning journey based on their specific interests. This approach enables learners to focus on plants that match their home environment and lifestyle.",

    title: "Specification & Instructional Script",
    image: "/lovable-uploads/plant-prototyping.png",
    description: "Before design, I created a detailed specification and instructional script to guide the learning experience. The spec outlined learning goals - behavioral, knowledge-based, and skill-oriented - and included audience analysis to identify gaps and preferences.\n\nThe script organized content around six houseplants, with descriptions, care tips, and real-life scenarios. It applied multimodal strategies using interactive assessments (e.g., drag-and-drop, scenario questions) to bridge knowledge gaps and keep learners engaged."

  designProcessAndAesthetics: "For the Plant Learning Module, I designed a visual experience that embodies the natural, organic feel of the subject matter. The color palette centers on various shades of green with earth tones for balance, creating a fresh, clean aesthetic that evokes plant life while maintaining excellent readability.\n\nTypography choices prioritize clarity and accessibility, with the Assistant font family at appropriate sizes for comfortable reading on various devices. Headings use SemiBold weight to maintain visual harmony while creating clear information hierarchy.\n\nThe interface layout employs a grid system that organizes content into digestible sections, with consistent spacing and alignment. Plant images feature prominently throughout the module, serving both instructional and aesthetic purposes. Each plant category uses subtle visual cues to help users track where they are in the learning journey.",

    description: "The module features engaging learning interactions:\n- Drag-and-drop activities matching plants to ideal light conditions\n- Interactive quizzes on watering requirements\n- Visual simulations showing plant responses to care conditions\n- Progress tracking for motivation and advancement\nThese assessments require users to apply knowledge in practical scenarios, simulating real-world plant care decisions."
  },
  challengesAndSolutions: "We addressed two primary challenges:\n\nBalancing Rich Content with User Approachability:\nInitial feedback showed that detailed care instructions could overwhelm novice plant owners. To solve this, we:\n\nDesigned a layered information system that starts with essentials and allows users to expand for more detail\n\nMarked beginner-friendly plants with visual cues\n\nIncluded calming, supportive messaging about common mistakes and how to recover from them\n\nCreating Meaningful Assessments:\nRather than using simple recall questions, we designed scenario-based activities—like choosing the best location or watering schedule for a plant—that built real-world decision-making skills and increased user confidence.\n\nThis project highlights my ability to turn complex instructional material into an engaging, approachable experience tailored to users' needs and learning goals.",
