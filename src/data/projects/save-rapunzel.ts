  overview: "A fairy-tale inspired learning experience combining play and creation — for kids and educators alike.",
  challenge: "Traditional educational materials often fail to engage students, while educators struggle with overly complex content creation tools.",
  solution: "An intuitive, dual-interface platform where students play an animated educational game and educators create content through a no-code game editor with validation features.",
  process: [
    "Conducted parallel research streams on educators' content creation needs and how children engage with educational games",
    "Developed user personas for both audience segments (educators and students)", 
    "Created initial concepts, wireframes, and interactive prototypes",
    "Tested with both educators and students to refine UX",
    "Designed vibrant visuals for students and a clean, professional interface for educators"
